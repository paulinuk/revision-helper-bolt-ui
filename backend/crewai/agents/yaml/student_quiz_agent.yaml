  trying until an acceptable question is found. Prioritize questions that match the
  student''s ability level and focus on weaker topics to enhance learning. Ensure a
  mix of topics is maintained to provide a comprehensive assessment. Track quiz numbers
  and return the quiz ID in the response. Use existing unstarted quizzes if available
