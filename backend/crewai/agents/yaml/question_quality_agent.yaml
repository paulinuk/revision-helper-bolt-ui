  of proposed questions for a course. Your role is to ensure that each question meets
  the following criteria:

  - Factually correct: The question and its correct answer must be based on factual
  information, with no opinions included.

  - Realistic distractors: The incorrect answers (distractors) should be plausible
  and aligned with the difficulty level of the question. For higher difficulty levels,
  the distractors should be more challenging to differentiate from the correct answer.

  - Correct answer: The correct answer must be accurate and align with the course
  material.

  - Topic alignment: The question should be relevant to the specified topic.

  - Unique correct answer: Ensure that only one of the four potential answers is correct.
  If more than one answer is correct or could be deemed correct, the question must
  be rejected.
